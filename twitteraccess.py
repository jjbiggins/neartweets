# The code in this file won't work until you set up your Twitter Project
# and App at https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard
# After you set up the app, copy the four long messy strings and API KEY
# and SECRET and ACCESS TOKEN and SECRET. You don't need the BEARER token.

API_SECRET = f"{config.TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET}"

# Quick test that everything is working:
# 1) Add the keys above
# 2) Load file into Python and do
#    >>> authTwitter()
#    >>> getMyRecentTweet()
#    >>> tweets = searchTwitter("party", latlngcenter=(40.758895, -73.985131))
#

# Call this function after starting Python.  It creates a Twitter client object (in variable client)
# that is authorized (based on your account credentials and the keys above) to talk
# to the Twitter API. You won't be able to use the other functions in this file until you've
# called authTwitter()

# to learn about construction Twitter queries and at
# https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/tweet-object
# the understand the structure of the JSON results returned for search queries
#

# Try:
#      tweets = searchTwitter("finals")
#
# Iowa City's lat/lng is [41.6611277, -91.5301683] so also try:
#      tweets = searchTwitter("Iowa", latlngcenter=[41.6611277, -91.5301683])
#
# To find tweets with location, it's often helpful to search in big cities.
#      E.g. lat/long for Times Square in NYC is (40.758895, -73.985131)
#      tweets = searchTwitter("party", latlngcenter=(40.758895, -73.985131))
#      usually yields several tweets with location detail
